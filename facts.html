            <h1>Facts And News</h1>
            <p>1. Each year, approximately 8 million metric tons of plastic
              waste enter the oceans, harming marine life and ecosystems.</p>
            <p>2. The average person generates about 4.4 pounds (2 kg) of waste
              per day, with a significant portion being recyclable
              materials.</p>
            <p>3. Recycling one ton of paper can save 17 trees, 7,000 gallons of
              water, and 463 gallons of oil.</p>
            <p>4. E-waste is the fastest-growing waste stream globally, with an
              estimated 50 million metric tons generated annually.</p>
            <p>5. Composting organic waste can reduce landfill waste by up to
              30% and produce nutrient-rich soil for gardening and
              agriculture.</p>

          tourist and pilgrimage loads.

          Positive Findings:

          Ganga River water in Rishikesh shows fairly good quality for aquatic
          life (DO ~10 mg/L).

          Baseline assessment of solid waste by Aviral Ganga Project quantifies
          waste and stakeholder awareness.

          State sanitation plan (Jan 2025) sets goals for city-wide sanitation
          and open-defecation elimination.

          Areas of Concern:

          Weak solid-waste management: no segregation at source, inadequate
          collection, open dumping.

          Sewage treatment capacity issues: Lakkarghat STP designed for 6 MLD,
          receives ~16 MLD; defunct STP poses environmental risk.

          Urban/tributary stretches (e.g., Chandrabhaga River) show poor water
          quality in some samples (DO as low as 0.4 mg/L).

          Plastic and litter issues during tourist/pilgrimage influxes remain a

          Air Quality:
          Average AQI ≈ 140–150 (moderate to poor); PM₁₀ ≈ 155 µg/m³, PM₂.₅ ≈ 88
          µg/m³. Winter smog and construction dust persist.
          ✅ Positive: City improved from 37th → 19th in Clean Air Survey 2025
          due to tree-planting, e-vehicles, and mechanised sweeping (TOI).

          Water Quality:
          Mostly Class A–B, but Rispana and Bindal streams still carry sewage
          and garbage.
          ✅ Positive: STP upgrades and monitoring are underway to improve river
          health (TOI, The Week).
          ❌ Negative: Pollution, encroachments, and untreated discharge continue
          to affect ecology, groundwater, and public health (TOI, Moneycontrol).
          How Clean is Dehradun Overall?

          Dehradun’s cleanliness level is moderate and improving, but far from
          ideal.
          Door-to-door collection and monitoring are better than before, yet
          segregation, waste processing, and water-stream cleanliness remain
          weak. Continuous construction, tourism pressure, and poor waste
          segregation keep the city in the “developing but not clean” bracket.
          Positive Developments

          Vacuum-based road sweepers introduced — first in Uttarakhand — to
          reduce roadside dust (Times of India, Apr 2025)

          Digital Deposit Refund System (DDRS) launched by the state to reduce
          plastic pollution (Economic Times Government, 2025)

          plastic-bank projects

          Air-quality monitoring network expanded under Smart City and NCAP
          programmes

          Negative Reports

          Garbage hotspots reappearing in many wards despite cleanup claims; DMC
          plans drone-based monitoring (Times of India, Oct 2025 — “Garbage
          hotspots reappear in Doon …”)

          CAG report found major shortcomings: only ≈ 3 % of waste segregated at
          source; several vehicles uncovered; open dumping still common (Times
          of India, Mar 2025 — “CAG report reveals major shortcomings in waste
          management …”)

          “Dustbin-free city” initiative backfired, leading to open littering in
          public spaces (Times of India, Feb 2025 — “Dustbin-free initiative
          failure …”)

          Kargi transfer station repeatedly overloaded, especially post-festival
          seasons (Times of India, Nov 2024 — “Dehradun’s Kargi transfer station
          flooded with 100 tonnes of post-Diwali garbage”)

              Waste collection delays in steep wards and narrow streets.
              Limited capacity for large-scale waste processing in hilly zones.

              Government / Initiative Actions:
              Enforcement of polythene ban and public awareness campaigns.
              Regular street and slope cleaning programs.
              Promotion of community participation in waste management.

              What Can Be Done:
              Improve waste collection logistics for steep and narrow wards.
              Expand composting or micro-waste processing units in hilly zones.
              Continue public-awareness campaigns for anti-littering and
              polythene alternatives.
